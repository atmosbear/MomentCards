# MomentCards

EDIT: This is now being rewritten! Stay tuned, and check out my project at www.github.com/atmosbear/MomentCards-rewrite/ :)

This is a very very rough work in progress! I am keeping it here to document the progress I'm making. :)

I decided to use React for this project just to get a feel for components in larger app. Not bad!

Dates and times were a bit tricky to get correct with this project - which correlates to many users on the State of JS survey saying that date and time are difficult in JS. But they're working OK right now! I will update this with any other challenges I face as I work on it.

Next goal is to save cards to local storage and mongo!
